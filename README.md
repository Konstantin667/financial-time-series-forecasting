# Financial Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA / SARIMA / ETS)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline for business revenue data, combining **Python for data preprocessing** and **R for statistical time series modeling**.

The goal is to simulate a realistic analytics workflow where raw transactional data is transformed into a clean time series and then used for forecasting with classical econometric models.

## Project Overview

**Key objectives:**
- Build a clean monthly revenue time series from transactional data
- Test stationarity and apply differencing
- Compare multiple forecasting models:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA
  - ETS (Exponential Smoothing)
- Perform backtesting and model comparison
- Produce interpretable forecasts suitable for business decision-making
